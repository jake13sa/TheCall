        <h2>The Call</h2>
        <p>Hey there,
            <br>
            Have you noticed someone close to you acting a bit different lately? Maybe they seem a little withdrawn or their usual sparkle isn't as bright? It's possible they're going through something tough, but they're keeping it bottled up.
            <br><br>
            Let's change that. Reach out to them. A simple conversation could make a world of difference. Let them know you're there to listen without judgment. Sometimes, all it takes is a caring ear to lift the weight off their shoulders.
            <br> <br>
            And if you're unsure of what to say or how to approach the topic, that's okay. Just being there to offer your support can mean everything. Your presence alone can bring comfort.
            <br><br>
            If you or someone you know needs immediate support, don't hesitate to reach out to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HopelinePH/">hotline</a>. They're available 24/7 to lend a compassionate ear and provide guidance.
            <br><br>
            Together, let's create a supportive community where no one feels alone in their struggles. Your kindness and understanding could be the beacon of light someone desperately needs.
            <br><br>
            Take care,
            <br><br>
            Jake</p>
